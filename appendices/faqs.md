### :spider\_web:  What is **Auto-Sniper Trading**? <a href="#what-is-listing-sniping" id="what-is-listing-sniping"></a>

Listing Sniping is a trading method used to maximise profits on launching projects/tokens. The idea behind Listing Sniping is once a project or token with popularity adds liquidity, a swarm of users will begin to buy, therefore driving up the price massively. To make the most out of those price increases, ideally, you want to be the first person to make a buy order so you can maximise your profits after the tokens price sky rockets. This is quite hard to do manually, which is why we have bots that constantly scan the Ethereum mempool, looking for the liquidity add transaction, and once it confirms it immediately sends a buy transaction. 🔸
